## General Info
This project was previously gulpjs-based. However, it seems that gulpjs isn't being updated anymore. So, the project was rewritten for the webpack framework.

## Technologies Used
The project that previously used the gulpjs framework. Now, it uses the webpack framework.

## Features
* Write and build Typescript code.
* Style the webapp with sass/scss.
* Run the webapp (for testing purposes) from the default browser.
* Build the project for development or production.

## Setup

## Usage
To build the project, use the 'build' command:
```
  npm run build
```

Then, we can run the app in the default browser by using the 'start' command:
```
  npm start
```

If we'd like, we can write tests for the jest testing framework, by running:
```
  npm run test
```
## Project Status
The project is in an ongoing status. Functionality for either creating a vanilla html, sass, ts project or a react project will be added soon. Also, functionality for defining production or development builds will be implemented in the future.

## Room for Improvement
There is functionality for nearly everything that is necessary to create a webapp these days. However, it will be useful to add functionality for react with the project.
