This project is based on youtube tutorials watched while learning web development. One example, in particular, is a tutorial from codercoder, which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0E1hbcj-NI). However, those videos included code based on older versions of Gulpjs. This project was built by following the Gulpjs documentation and requirements needs from development workflow at that time.
