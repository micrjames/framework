## General Info
This project was initially developed to help with writing code, building apps, and testiing those apps. During the process of learning website and web app development, the background processes needed to create a template for a project, spin up a server, and run the app were found to be a bit tedious and repetitive. So, in order to focus more on the writing of code for the apps, this project was created to automate those processes. As a nice side effect, quite a lot was learned about the underlying technologies involved in creating web apps and what goes on behind the scenes to get the content on the screen.
## Technologies Used
Some of the development technologies used to create the project include:
* Browser-sync - version: 2.27.7
* Gulp - version: 4.0.2
* Sass - version: 1.43.4
* Gulp-cli - version: 2.3.0
* And, of course, JavaScript, with all the amazing ES6 features.
## Features
All of the features that are included in this project help automate and allow the developer to focus on writing the code for the app, including:
* Spin up a development server that watches HTML, CSS, and JavaScript development files for updates and immediately updates the screen with the changes.
* Similary, a user can spin up a developer server for the purpose of viewing served content, which is not watched for changes.
* Transpile Sass code to CSS.
* Build a production version of the website or web app so as to be transferred to a production server.

## Acknowledgements
This project is based on youtube tutorials watched while learning web development. One example, in particular, is a tutorial from codercoder, which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0E1hbcj-NI). However, those videos included code based on older versions of Gulpjs. This project was built by following the Gulpjs documentation and requirements needs from development workflow at that time.
